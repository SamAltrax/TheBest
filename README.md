1.Before Vall Corporation was released in this dusty place

City 57 was an strict combine city looked like city 17 but its not city 17
so in 7:00 at City 57 groups of raiders terminates all combines to rule the entire city
and they think its cool but.

suddenly they litterly nuked the place and they accidently nuked themself too
so two years have past.. all citizens are starving and then Jack Sevack one of the citizens
decided to sell guns and be a gun dealer.

but 3 days later Vall Corporation founded the dusty place and then they tried to dig the
cave down and make the border and thats it!
